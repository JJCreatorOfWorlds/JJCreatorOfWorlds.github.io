                <h2>BotW Sword</h2>
                <p>
                    A sword design based on a few of my favorite BotW swords, I designed it myself and had
                    a blast painting. It was a gift for my best friend and they loved it! By far the capstone
                    of my model making skills. <br> <br>
                    if i did it again i would spend a decent ammount of time sanding it, as right now its a tiny
                    bit rough. though the addition of glow in the dark paint more than makes up for that fact

                <p>
                    a sword made from a combonation of a couple thingiverse models. I love how it came out but 
                    its not one of the things im most proud of. The blade was designed my me but the handle and rose
                    were combined into it using meshmixer. Im very happy with the finish on the blade and I used
                    a steel rod for the core, which makes it fun to swing around!

                    The concept art for this sword was designed by Fyerix#4447 on discord for 
                    an art contest I helped to host. They submitted several designs and all of them 
                    were amazing! I love the firey color and enjoyed the challenge of getting the 
                    sword to come apart easily for shipping.

                <p>
                    This sword is a replica of the Tesseract Abyss sword from the game 
                    Swords of Gargantua (which got shut down after a few years) 
                    It's the oldest project I've showcased on this platform and 
                    I'm still impressed with how clean the seam lines on the blade are!
                    I would love to sell the STL file for the sword, but It was on my old computer
                    and I can't get to it any more. I still have the origional though!

                    Custom lightsaber for my friend as a Christmas gift! 
                    It was my first big project on the lathe and it turned out ok. 
                    I'm much more confident that I can machine stuff now but I do wish 
                    I had more time to add more details. It is powered by a flashlight 
                    and turns on by pressing a button at the bottom of the hilt. The blade 
                    is from Vire Sabers. If I was doing this again I would probably just buy 
                    the blade tip from them and then get a piece of tube from somewhere else.
