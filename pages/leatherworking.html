                <h2>Messenger Bag</h2>
                <p>
                    I designed and made this bag from scratch, and hand stitching all the seams
                     took over 10 hours. Leatherworking is probably the one thing I wouldn't do a
                      commission for, people who do it for fun scare me. In terms of the actual project
                       I would advise against mixing real and fake leather, the straps are noticeably 
                       weaker than the genuine leather, and ill probably need to replace them at some point.

                    Leather corset pattern, hand sewn and cut. I had a lot of fun with this project 
                    and look forward to doing more leather work in the future! <br>

                    definitely buy the hardware separately, I was able to cut the cost in half 
                    compared to what they're asking for on the website.
