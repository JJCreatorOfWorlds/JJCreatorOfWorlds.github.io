                <h2>Ugly Swords</h2>
                <p>
                    These were swords I made for a ren faire with my friends. We each wanted
                    our own swords and I tried to make everyone one. they all are really bad
                    for a variety of reasons. The rapier I reused to make another sword but the 
                    other two just got thrown away. The paint didn't look great and 
                    i spent nowhere near the correct ammount of time sanding.

                    this sign was originaly going to be a gift for Mitch at taverntalesgame.com but that 
                    never ended up happening. I actually did end up painting it but just wasn't happy with
                    how it worked and never got around to fixing it.

                    I made the STL file for this while on a call with my friends late at night
                    I then printed it out and promptly forgot about it. I ended up throwing
                    it away before I ever got it finished and I dont even have the STL file 
                    for it any more. Oh well.

                <p>
                    this is the oldest project on the website. It was made of paper rolls
                    and duct tape. I had a lot of fun with it but no real plan for what 
                    it would end up as. one day i came home and it had fallen, so i threw it out 
                    the lesson here being to have a plan for the project or you won't care if it has
                    issues.

                <p>
                    This blimp was a mess. you can see how the back motor would turn to move it forward and the
                    bottom motors would counteract the force of the helium in the balloon. 
                    I never really got to see how much of a mess it was because the balloon i 
                    was using popped when it hit the ceiling. oh well. I did get to talk about
                    the lessons it taught me in a job interview so maybe it was worth it.
