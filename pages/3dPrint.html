                <h2>Orrery</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my most technically complicated project to date, the orrery shows the 
                    proportional rotation speeds of planets. The design was done by Widget Wiz 3D 
                    and is one of the best I've ever seen!

                     Here's a T-Rex skeleton I painted and printed from a Thingiverse model designed
                     by MakerBot (www.thingiverse.com/thing:275091) I absolutely loved painting it, 
                     there was so much texture that I could keep doing highlights and washes forever!

                <p>
                    a dice tower from the VR RPG system Tavern Tales. origionaly I was 
                    going to sell these with Mitch on his website but the timing didn't work
                    out. I ended up making around 5 of them for various people and they 
                    all loved them! I may consider selling them again if anyone is intrested.

                <p>
                    taken straight from thingiverse it's a great model that held up fairly well 
                    im pretty sure its in 3 pieces right now but I haven't had a reason to fix it 
                    an Amazon Alexa sits in the base and plays music. It was a fun thing to have!
