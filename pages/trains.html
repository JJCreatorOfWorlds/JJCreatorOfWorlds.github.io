                <p>
                    A custom box car made using a menards box car, some paint, and a UV printer for the stickets.
                    It was a really fun project and I would love to work on more like them in the future. They do
                    take quite a bit of time due to all the different stages of painting but I think it's worth it.
                    I was told by some people on a model train form that the registration numbers should be on the
                    left side- oops! <br> <br>

                    I would be happy to make these for other people, but if the image supplied is too tall then it
                    will need to be cut down, fair warning!
