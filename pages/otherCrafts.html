                <h2>Hurdy Gurdy</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a hurdy gurdy model made from the nerdy gurdy design documents.
                    it really doesn't work because I havent put the time in to tune it. i would be happy to sell
                    it to someone who would use it. Though it is a mess at the moment. Some day ill get around
                    to fixing it.

                <h2>Trollskull Manor</h2>
                <p>
                    This Project was hand built from cardboard, popsicle sticks, and cardstock. 
                    It's based on the Trollskull Manor from Waterdeep dragon heist. My favorite part 
                    of this project is still the roof, the green, and black really stand out and It gives 
                    some color to something that's otherwise very drab.

                <h2>Cerberus Airship</h2>
                <p>
                    This airship is for a D&D character I played from level 1 to level 20, their 
                    name is Aero and they're a half-elf multiclass thingy. This airship model is 
                    another old project, the design on the sail leaves a lot to be desired but other 
                    than that I'm very proud of it. The planks of wood are mostly cardstock, but 
                    on the deck, I used popsicle sticks. I love to drybrush and this project was 
                    perfect for that!
